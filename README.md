# fast_ISM
Octave port of the Fast Image Source Model by Eric A. Lehmann. Used for room acoustic modeling and impulse response simulation. 

See original MATLAB files and explanation of usage [here](http://www.eric-lehmann.com/) under the "Fast ISM code" on the left-hand navigation bar. 

Nothing has changed on the usage according to the linked website above, only syntax for some internal commands were updated so they could be used in Octave.
