function xx = logistic_rnd(mm,nn,mu,ss)
%logistic_rnd  Generates samples from the logistic distribution
% 
% X = logistic_rnd(M,N,MU,S)
%
% Returns an M-by-N matrix X containing random numbers distributed
% according to the logistic distribution with location (mean) MU and 
% scale S. The code implemented using the inversion method.
